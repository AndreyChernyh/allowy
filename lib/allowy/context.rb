module Allowy

  # This module provides the default and common context for checking the permissions.
  # It is mixed into controllers in Rails by default and provides an easy way to reuse it
  # in other parts of the application (in RSpec or Cucumber) without needing a controller.
  # For example, you can use this code in your Cucumber features:
  #
  #   @example
  #   class CustomContext
  #     include Allowy::Context
  #     attr_accessor :current_user
  #
  #     def initialize(user)
  #       @current_user = user
  #     end
  #
  # And then you can easily check the permissions like so:
  #
  #   @example
  #   CustomContext.new(that_user).should be_able_to :create, Blog
